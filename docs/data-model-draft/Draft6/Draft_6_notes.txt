Draft 6 notes

'question_desc' row in QUESTIONS table is where the example answer or the helpful description of a question can be stored.  It can also be left blank.

added distinct column names for the different 'name' columns.  so we have faculty_name and division_name instead of 'name' and 'name'

faculty has one primary division, referenced by a foreign key.

added ENUM for DROPDOWN question type, as dropdowns are probably going to be used on the frontend.

ENUMS:
	FACULTY:
		employee_type: 'FULLTIME','PARTTIME'
	TIPS:
		quarter: 'FALL','WINTER','SPRING','SUMMER'
	QUESTIONS:
		question_type: 'TEXT','RADIO','CHECKBOX','DROPDOWN'
