- go to c9.io
- create new workspace

- select 'Hosted Workspace tab'
  - under "Clone from Git or Mercurial URL (optional)", in the text field, 
    - paste the URL "https://github.com/panzerama/NSC-AD410-TIP-GROUP1"
    
- select blank template, second to last template option at the time of this writing.

- click create workspace.
... wait for workspace to build

- in the c9 terminal window
  - type "cd prod" to move into the production folder.
  - type "composer update --no-scripts" to reset php artisan and get everything running smoothly
  ... wait for composer to update, will take a minute or two.
  
  - remaining in terminal, type "git branch {descriptive branch name}" to create your working branch
  - type "git checkout {descriptive branch name}" to move into your working branch

- Do your coding, make your feature, whatever you came here to do

- when you're done coding/creating go back into a terminal window
  - type "git status" to see a list of all the files you've changed in your branch
    (cool thing about c9! you can click on a file directly to git add it! go ahead and try it out.)
    
  - make sure that all your changed files that you would like to commit have had "git add {file name}" done to them, either by clicking or by manually typing.
  
  - type "git commit -m "{descriptive message goes here}" to commit your changes to your branch
  
  - type "git push" to push your branch from cloud9 up to the github repo. 
    - enter github username
    - enter github password
    
  - now you should be able to open a webpage @ https://github.com/panzerama/NSC-AD410-TIP-GROUP1 and it should show you that you just pushed a branch, with an optional button to "compare/pull request" 
  
  - click on the pull request button and follow the steps like usual to have your code reviewed and merged.
  
To make sure that your branch on your workspace is up to date you can enter the terminal and type "git fetch" and you should be caught up.
