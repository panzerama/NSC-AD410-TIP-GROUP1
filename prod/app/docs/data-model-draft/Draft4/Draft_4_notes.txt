notes on 4th data model revision

Hello group,

Thanks for letting do data modeling. If anyone else is into it please don't let me hog it all, I really do enjoy it though so thank you.

I left course_name as a VARCHAR(45) in the TIPS table.  I think course prefix and number would go here in one field.  Is there a reason to have those separate? would the group like them to be separate?

added a DIVISIONS table

added is_active BOOL to the ANSWERS table as well, in case they change/delete an answer but don't change the question.

added a bunch of columns to the FACULTY table, referencing the UI mockups I'm looking at.

quarter and year remain in the TIPS table, but no where else.  So as it stands we can't populate those dropdowns, at least not from the database. quarter is set to an ENUM of FALL, WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER. So quarter could just be a hardcoded array in our backend.  year is set to an INT, since that might be the easiest way to run it with SQLLite.  Is there a cutoff time for faculty to get their TIP entered, because if there is than the year could just be the current year generated by our website.  

Do you want me to create and fit in a COURSES table, on the off chance we get current data that we would like to check against? I'm pretty suspicious of a table that large being kept up to date, but if you want it I'll do it. 

Please get back to me with any input at all and please tell me whatâ€™s missing. The sooner we get this finalized and squared away, the better. Thanks!
