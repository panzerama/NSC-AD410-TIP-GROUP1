Draft 5 notes

Added a 'question_desc' row to QUESTIONS table, this is where the example answer or the helpful description of a question will be stored.  It can also be left blank.

added distinct column names for the different 'name' columns.  so we have faculty_name and division_name instead of name and name

ENUMS:
	FACULTY:
		employee_type: 'FULLTIME','PARTTIME'
	TIPS:
		quarter: 'FALL','WINTER','SPRING','SUMMER'
	QUESTIONS:
		question_type: 'TEXT','RADIO','CHECKBOX'
