Status Report

- Assisted in presentation to faculty 6/15/17.
To-do:
- Change 'Tips by division' report to display % faculty per division, rather than number of faculty members per division.
    This will allow a more accurate comparison across divisions which may have dramatically different numbers of faculty.
- Continue to work on .csv export of reports data.
- Work on documentation for the application.
