Status update for 5/19

Approaching a workable login authorization.   
I spent a few hours today working Paul's example code into our login controller.  
After reading up more on the Canvas documentation I'm getting the impression we will need a redirect controller as well.

I have high hopes for having it all working or at least testable tomorrow.
