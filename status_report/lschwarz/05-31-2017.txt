Started testing the LoginController with Michael today.

I worked with Travis to fix all the routing issues I was having because I hadn't fixed them after I deleted the SessionController.php

Tomorrow I hope to work with Michael to hopefully squash the last of the LoginController bugs and then move on to adding more features.
