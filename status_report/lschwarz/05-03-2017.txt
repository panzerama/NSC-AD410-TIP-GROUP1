Created one many-to-many model relationship in Laravel, as an example to others.

Created some dummy data to start to test against.

Talked more with other teammates about a few more revisions that need to happen to the database design.

Talked with teammates about the authentication piece.

Over the next few days I need to help to implement the user authentication from Canvas.
