Status update for Wed 5/24

I've started trying to get session handling going in our app.  

I'd like to have it done by this weekend so that Michael can test it and the rest of the team can help implement it. 

This should be done with code that can just be included in every page that needs it.

If that gets done and the RedirectController gets built than we should be in pretty good shape for demo next week.
