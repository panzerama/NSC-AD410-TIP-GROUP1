Status Report

- Model factories built and implemented
- Some changes likely coming from Bonnie in the near future
- Ilsa and I are working on implementing the Datatables library, changing the payload of data generated by the reports controller
- Design for search function. This issue, while critical, has been delayed by other tasks. I'm shutting down other issues and focusing solely on this for the next 4 days.
