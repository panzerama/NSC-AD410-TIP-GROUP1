Status Report

What have you completed since the last report?
	- Attended Travis' overview session on MVC/Laravel/Cloud 9
	- Got a good understanding on simple workflow for the project
	- Familiarized myself with overall baseline and architecture of the project

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
	- go over rest of laravel videos, including phpunit testing 
	- create simple unit test and evaluate if learning curve for going TDD path on this project is reasonable given amount of the things team already needs to learn 

What is getting in your way?
	- the amount of things that we need to learn as part of configurating environment/tools is overwhelming. IMO, this by itself should be a seperate class. We are lucky to have people on the team who already used and are familiar with this environment so having them helps enormously (Thanks to Travis, Jason and Michael). The steep learning curve is currently the only thing that is getting in the way.
