Status Report

What have you completed since the last report?
	- Familiarized with documentation and examples on OAuth
	- Trying to figure out configuration setup on workspace to make authentication work
	- Spend multiple hours trying to execute sample unit test (Blocked right now until I figure what is is missing from the configuration) 

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
	- have prototype for authenticating working
	- find help to figure out why i can't execute tests from terminal as is

What is getting in your way?
	- Mostly blocked by lack of experience on how to configure environment correctly. I was able to make phpunit be recognizable in my workspace but still not able to execute test sample, very likely missing setup how to run this from terminal.
