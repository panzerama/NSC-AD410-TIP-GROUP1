Worked with Karen to finish off the Edit Tips page. 
Set up Async Ajax to handle Edit List and Edit Divisions Modals. This took longer than expected since I had to learn 
and deal with JQuery and Ajax Get/Post handling. However the result works pretty well and eliminates the need for 
additional pages. 
Fixed a few issues with buttons/fields/functionality that stopped working as the page got built out. 
I am going to run several more full page tests with a fresh database migration now that we are finished with all of the 
main functionality.
Started commenting and documentation of Edit Tips.
