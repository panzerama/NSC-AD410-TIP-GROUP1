Build out model relationships for Tips, Questions, Answers and Tip_questions. Waiting for Jason to finish the last 3 to push to master.
Met with Mitch and Khang to discuss passing database data to the views. 
Added connections to pass test data to the edit-tips view. 
Started planning out store functionality for tips/edittips. Due to dynamically building out the forms a much more complex 
post request controller will be needed.
