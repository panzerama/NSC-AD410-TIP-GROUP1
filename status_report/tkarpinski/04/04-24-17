Worked with Luke and Jason to develop a streamlined and functional way to manage workspaces in cloud 9 and github. 
Trouble shooted some of the Laravel issues resulting from c9 and github itegration. 
Continued to learn Laravel with a main focus on Eloquent Relationship Management, Query Builder and Artisan Tinker.
