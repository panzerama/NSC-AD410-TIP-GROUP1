Worked on the logic statements for the create tip and save in progress tip. The processes are pretty similair so 
I may try to condense or reuse. As is when a new tip is created it pulls the active question list from the database, creates
a new tip, and then uses a foreach to create the relationships/answer fields in tips_questions. To save it runs a smiliar for each loop
to process any reponse data in to its accociated answer field. I will try to get enough test data tomorrow to test. 
Helped Rasa with PHPUnit.
