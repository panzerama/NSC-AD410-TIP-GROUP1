Continued working on Edit-Tips controller and library functions. 
Ran in to some issues passing data to subviews or modals. I tried using javascript to dynamically set the data fields which works
except for displaying the existing question text in the modify modal. 
Attended meeting with Alissa with Michael and Karen.
